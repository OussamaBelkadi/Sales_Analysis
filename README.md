## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### üíæ Data Preprocessing

- Load Excel file: `sales_data.xlsx`
- Clean column names and parse dates
- Create new columns:
  - `Sales = Order Quantity √ó Unit Selling Price`
  - `Cost = Order Quantity √ó Unit Cost`
  - `Profit = Sales - Cost`
  - `Profit Margin = Profit / Sales`

### üßÆ Aggregation

The data is grouped using `groupby()` to calculate:

- Total sales by product, city, month, year, customer
- Profits by channel and year
- Top & bottom 5 customers by sales

### üìà Visualizations

Generated using:
- `matplotlib` for bar and line charts
- `seaborn` for color palettes
- `plt.savefig()` to export charts as `.png` files in `output/`
